# Texture Assets Directory

This directory should contain the following texture files required by the Tender Opulence Hub application:

- black-marble.jpg - Used for the marble footer background
- gold-veins.png - Overlay for the marble texture
- crystal-normal.jpg - Normal map for crystal prisms in the dashboard
- earth-blue-marble.jpg - Texture for the globe in the hero section
- velvet-texture.jpg - Texture for the bookshelf in the learning hub
- parchment.jpg - Texture for the scrolls in the learning hub
- book-cover-gold.jpg - Texture for "Tender Basics" books
- book-cover-emerald.jpg - Texture for "Advanced Strategies" books
- book-cover-blue.jpg - Texture for "Legal Framework" books
- book-cover-purple.jpg - Texture for "Documentation" books
- book-cover-copper.jpg - Texture for "Negotiations" books

## Placeholder Usage

During development, if you don't have the actual texture files, you can use placeholder images:

1. You can create placeholder images using services like:
   - https://placehold.co/600x400/1A2A44/D4AF37?text=Texture
   - https://placeholder.com/

2. For normal maps and other specialized textures, consider using:
   - Basic noise textures from tools like GIMP or Photoshop
   - Free textures from sites like textures.com (with appropriate licensing)

## Resolution Recommendations

For optimal performance and visual quality:
- Standard textures: 1024x1024 or 2048x2048
- Normal maps: 1024x1024
- Large background textures (like marble): 2048x2048
- Book covers: 512x512

## File Format

- JPG: For photographic textures (marble, book covers)
- PNG: For textures that require transparency (gold veins, special effects)
- For normal maps, use JPG with high quality settings
